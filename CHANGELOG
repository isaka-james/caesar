# Changelog  
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.  

## [Released] / [1.1.0] - 2025-03-24
### Added  
- Platform detection logic for Debian-based systems and Termux.  
- Dynamic executable naming (`caesar_executable` for Debian, `termux_executable` for Termux).  

### Changed  
- **BREAKING**: Migrated installation paths from system-wide directories (`/opt`, `/sbin`) to user-local paths (`~/.local/share`, `~/.local/bin`).  
- Installation script now avoids `sudo` by default for improved security and accessibility.  

### Fixed  
- Backward compatibility with existing installations during path transitions.  
- Permission handling for non-root users.
